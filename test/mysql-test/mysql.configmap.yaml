    # A Lot of Fast Connections + Small Set of Queries + DisconnectsÂ¶
    # If you are doing a lot of fast connections / disconnects, you should increase back_log and if you are running MariaDB 10.1 or below thread_cache_size.
    # If you have a lot (> 128) of simultaneous running fast queries, you should consider setting thread_handling to pool_of_threads.
    # Defaults to "The lower of 900 and (50 + max_connections/5) (>= MariaDB 10.1.7)" 50 + (151/5) = 80
    back_log = 200

    # DNS lookups are expensive and we have no connection pool with php/wordpress
    # Therefore, we fully disable DNS name resolve for client-connections on our database (cache is no longer used, also disabled)
