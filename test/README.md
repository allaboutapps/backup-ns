This folder holds namespaced manifests that are only meant to be executed on a KIND cluster.
The hostpath CSI driver and its snapshots are not meant to be used in a production environment!

This is a test only environment setup!

```bash
# Within your dev container with a working kind cluster
./init.sh
```
